-- Migration 038: Tech Lead Bonus Earn Trigger
--
-- When a pm_ticket transitions to 'completed' on a piece of equipment that has
-- an approved, unearned tech_lead attached, and the linked pm_schedule is
-- flat_rate billing with interval_months IN (1,2,3) (monthly / bi-monthly /
-- quarterly), mark the lead 'earned' and lock in bonus_amount = schedule.flat_rate.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER: needed because tech_leads UPDATE is restricted to super_admin
-- + manager, but the trigger must run as any user who completes a PM (technicians
-- included). The function only does the narrow earn UPDATE — no other writes.

  'Earns an approved tech_lead on first eligible PM completion. Eligible = schedule.billing_type=flat_rate AND interval_months IN (1,2,3). SECURITY DEFINER bypasses tech_leads UPDATE RLS so techs can complete their own tickets without explicit permission on tech_leads. NOTE: trigger is AFTER UPDATE OF status only — a direct INSERT with status=completed (e.g. seed/migration data) will NOT fire this trigger. Normal app flow always transitions through unassigned/assigned/in_progress, so this gap is unreachable from the UI.';
